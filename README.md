# octo-ndfa
An epsilon-NDFA simulator in Python. I originally created this as part of a class on automata and computability, but it turned into a useful tool for making sure I understood how they worked and as such I expanded it to simulate different bits.

This was never intended to be publicly-consumable code and as such is lacking in documentation/not crashing horribly when something isn't as it expects, but I thought it might be useful for someone else to poke at and see how it was implemented, so here you go!

I've included some sample NDFA files that model regular expressions and the chessboard NDFA described [in these Stanford infolab slides.](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/ialc/spr10/slides/fa3.pdf).
